        <h2>Assam</h2>
        <p>Assam, state of India. It is located in the northeastern part of the country and is bounded to the north by the kingdom of Bhutan and the state of Arunachal Pradesh, to the east by the states of Nagaland and Manipur, to the south by the states of Mizoram and Tripura, and to the west by Bangladesh and the states of Meghalaya and West Bengal.

The capital, formerly Shillong (now the capital of Meghalaya), was shifted to Dispur, a suburb of Guwahati, in 1972. Area 30,285 square miles (78,438 square km). Pop. (2011) 31,169,272.</p>

        <p>The Bihus are the national festivals of Assam. There are three such festivals in Assam: in the months of Bohaag (Baisakh, the middle of April), Maagh (the middle of January), and Kaati (Kartik, the middle of October).

The Bohaag Bihu marks the New Year at the advent of seeding time, the Kaati Bihu marks the completion of sowing and transplanting of paddies, and the Maagh Bihu marks the end of the harvesting period. Bohaag Bihu is also called the Rongaali Bihu or the Festival of Merriment, Maagh Bihu is also called Bhogaali Bihu or the Festival of Food, Kaati Bihu is also called Kongaali Bihu or the Festival of the Poor.</p>

        <h2> Effect of Flood</h2>
        <p>The situation began to turn critical ever since the state experienced pre-monsoon showers in April and May this year. The breach in embankments along the Brahmaputra river and its various tributaries has caused flooding in 23 out of 35 districts in the state and has submerged crops in over 2 lakh hectares.96 Revenue Circles and 2,930 villages have been impacted by flood incidents, including approximately 1.9 million people, over 100,000 of which are taking shelter in 373 relief camps. 54 people have lost their lives due to flooding and landslides across the state since the monsoon season began on April 6, 2022. </p>

        <h2 style="color:darkblue">Deforestation</h2>
        <p style="color:blue">
            16, 744 sq. Km of forest have been cleared in incident from 2001–2018 out which, 2388 sq. Km forest was of Assam. During 2013 to 2018, out 6,867 sq. Km 1400 sq. Km (more than 20%) was the forest of Assam.[1] Since deforestation is one of major reason of floods, it is needed to reduced. Migration and unplanned development is one of the major cause of deforestation in Assam. </p>

            <h2 style="color:darkblue">Breached Embankments</h2>
            <p style="color:blue">Most of the embankment on Brahamputra are not in good condition and are damaged which is major reason of floods.[3] Most of the embankment were built in 1980s as a temporary solution and they have become weaker by time.[4] It has been suggested that embankments should be checked before monsoon every year.</p>

            <h2 style="color:darkblue">Encroachment of flood plains</h2>
            <p style="color:blue">Flood plain is the land near the bank of any river, if the river get flooded that water get accumulated on it. Encroachment of flood plains is also one of the major reasons of flood. It has been suggested that flood plains can be divided in several zones depending upon their vulnerability, several activities like farming and construction can be banned on them.[2]</p>
